# de-codedev
Contains Projects worked on free time and playing around some functions,controls and codes.

#Clone or fork it?
Well, should I clone or fork it? The question is, are you going to contribute to the project (which you're encouraged to do by the way)? If not, then you only need to clone it.But
# If you are developer then you can even make some code changes if it is required.
And also can send the pull requests to the repository.
