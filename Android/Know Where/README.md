KnowWhere
=========
Android Application Developed based on the Problem given by the NASA.
Using the resources given by them.
NASA Space Apps Challenge 2014.

In this application we have developed a basic Quiz Model where the user will be presented by the Satellite Pictures of some Monuments, Places etc.
They should answer by identifying the picture.
If they give "Right Answer" the information about the picture will be displayed.

Since it is somewhat difficult we even have added the "Tutorial" so that they can accustom themselves with the Satellite Pictures.
