NASA Space Apps Challenge 2015
--------------------------------
In this we have developed an Android Application in which the "Astronauts" can take pictures and store them in there account.
First when they launch the Application they have to register and then upload can take pictures and 
upload them to their accounts in the Application.

And also can make them as "Post Cards", and share the link with there friends and family members.
Even we are planning to introduce a customized Background where they can choose any background 
for the Picture from the available Backgrounds and their "Custom Background".

We will be also be developing this application for Windows and Apple Platforms.

# The Android App is built by using the Local System IP Address so people who want to fork the Project, should first change the "Network Address" and then start the 'Debugging'.

Also see that you are connected to Internet because I have written the code in that way.
Trying to change the code so that it even works without "Internet" (Tried with 'Localhost' but Application stops.)

Will be updating the Code as soon I find the way and also some free time. (Now-a-days busy with Academics).

I have used "Wamp Server 2.2" since "mysql" is not supported in the latest versions and also there are some errors which caused me de-grade to old build of "Wamp Server".
